**Objective:** Today, we explored the use of the Stream API for more efficient data manipulation and the principles of refactoring to improve code readability and maintainability. We also practiced creating a concept map to visually organize and connect key ideas.

**Reflective:** rewarding

**Interpretive:** The introduction of Stream API and refactoring techniques provided fresh insights into simplifying code without losing functionality. While the learning curve was noticeable, the concept map helped in grasping the relationships between different elements and their applications.

**Decision:** I aim to apply the Stream API in upcoming tasks and actively refactor existing code to reinforce these practices and enhance my problem-solving approach.
